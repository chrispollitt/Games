.SH NAME
maze4 \- A thrilling autonomous maze race between Fruitbots and dastardly vegetables in the Maze of Munch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maze4
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
In a high-tech corner of Nourishvale, where wires meet wilderness, the Fruitbots were engineered by rival fruit factions, each vying for the ultimate prize: to be crowned champion of the Maze of Munch.

Designed with unique strengths and strategies, Rapid Raspberry, Bussin' Blueberry, Lightning Lemon, and Kwick Kiwi must race, strategize, and battle their way through a treacherous labyrinth. 

.PP
But beware — this is no leisurely stroll through the garden.

Lurking within the maze are dastardly Veggie Monsters — like Abyssal Artichoke, Creeping Carrot, and Brutal Broccoli — programmed to ambush and stall the racers. Each encounter is a high-stakes gamble. Lose three battles, and a bot's system will overload, forcing them to forfeit the race. Some battles happen at critical junctions — lose there, and the bot may be permanently trapped. It's bot against bot, bot against monster, and even monster against monster! No mercy!

The maze is randomly generated each round, filled with dead ends, teleporters, and crucial intersections. Only one bot will emerge victorious, claiming the title of “Supreme Produce” and a place in Nourishvale history.

This is a fully autonomous simulation. No player input is required to run the game. Just sit back and enjoy the chaos.

That said, you can control the simulation speed and flow using the following keys during gameplay:

.TP
.B SPC
Pause / unpause the game

.TP
.B q
Quit the game

.TP
.B \- / +
Slow down / speed up game speed

.TP
.B ↑ / ↓ (while paused)
Scroll through recent battle history results.

.SH INSPIRATION
This project draws inspiration from the classic
.B X11 Maze
screensaver and the chaotic drama of
.BR Jelle's Marble Runs.
It combines the hypnotic visual patterns of procedural maze-solving with the unscripted excitement of autonomous agents battling for glory.

All game logic, bot behavior, monster encounters — and yes, even this manpage — were generated or assisted by large language models using AI.
