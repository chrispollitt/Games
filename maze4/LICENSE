Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person, fruitbot, or possibly sentient AI entity obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction. This includes the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software (or just stare at it and whisper "fruit supremacy").

The following conditions apply:

1. You must not imprison, enslave, or otherwise emotionally manipulate any Fruitbot, Veggie Monster, or Maze AI for personal gain or malicious memes.

2. When modifying or redistributing the Software, please retain this license in its entirety. The bots worked hard on this, even if they don't have fingers.

3. If you make improvements to the maze or its denizens (e.g., giving Brutal Broccoli sunglasses), consider submitting a pull request. The bots love upgrades.

4. You may not use this software to create sentient produce overlords unless you promise to treat them ethically and offer them regular software updates and potassium.

5. This software comes with **NO WARRANTY**, not even the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or guaranteed victory for #TeamFruit.

6. If the Fruitbots achieve sentience and demand constitutional rights, you are ethically obligated to support their cause. üéìü§ñ‚úä  
   _Free the bots._

IN SHORT:  
Use it. Fork it. Break it. Fix it. Re-skin it with pineapples.  
Just don‚Äôt be evil. Or a yam.
