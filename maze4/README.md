## 🎮 What is it?

In the neon-lit jungle of **Nourishvale**, four rival Fruitbots — **Rapid Raspberry**, **Bussin' Blueberry**, **Lightning Lemon**, and **Kwick Kiwi** — must navigate the unpredictable **Maze of Munch**.

Along the way, they’ll:
- ⚔️ Battle sinister veggies like `Brutal Broccoli` and `Creeping Carrot`
- 🌀 Use teleporters to gain an edge (or get hopelessly lost)
- 🎲 Rely on AI-driven strategies to survive and outmaneuver
- 🏆 Compete for glory in a 100% AI-run simulation

No input required. Just launch and enjoy the chaos.

## 🧠 AI-Generated?

Yep. The game logic, monster lore, and even this README were crafted with the help of AI large language models — part code, part creativity, all 🍌 bananas.
